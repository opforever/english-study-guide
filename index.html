    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Muted Teal -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a fixed sidebar for primary navigation between the guide's main parts (Narration, Verbs, Essay, Paragraph). The main content area dynamically displays the selected topic. Within the Narration section, a secondary tab-based navigation is used to separate different sentence types. This structure was chosen to break down the dense information into manageable, user-selectable chunks, preventing overwhelm and improving focus. The user flow is simple: select a major topic from the sidebar, then interact with sub-topics in the main content area. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Narration Rules -> Goal: Inform -> Presentation: Styled HTML tables for clarity. Interaction: None. Justification: Standard, effective format for rule data. | Narration Sentence Types -> Goal: Organize -> Presentation: JS-powered tabs. Interaction: User clicks tab to reveal specific content. Justification: Segments a large topic into digestible parts. | Verbs Classification -> Goal: Organize -> Presentation: JS-powered accordion. Interaction: User clicks header to expand/collapse content. Justification: Neatly organizes distinct definitions, encouraging focused learning. | Essay/Paragraph -> Goal: Inform -> Presentation: Clean, styled text blocks. Interaction: None. Justification: Best for presenting prose content. -->

                    <p>Sports and games are an essential part of a healthy and well-rounded life. They are more than just a form of entertainment; they are a vital activity for developing both the body and the mind. Engaging in regular physical activity builds physical fitness, strengthens character, and teaches the importance of working together, making it crucial for holistic personal growth.</p>
                    <p>On a physical level, sports are fundamental for maintaining health. Regular participation strengthens the heart, builds strong muscles, and helps manage weight, preventing many lifestyle-related illnesses. Beyond the body, sports significantly boost mental well-being. The focus required during a game sharpens concentration, while the physical exertion acts as a powerful stress reliever. Facing challenges on the field builds mental resilience, equipping individuals with a stronger, more positive mindset to handle life's difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, sports serve as an excellent training ground for character and social skills. They instill invaluable life lessons like discipline, determination, and how to handle both victory and defeat gracefully. Team sports, in particular, foster a spirit of cooperation by teaching effective communication, trust, and leadership. Players learn to work together towards a common goal, developing skills that are highly transferable to academic and professional life.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the benefits of sports and games extend far beyond the playing field. They are instrumental in building strong bodies, sharp minds, and well-rounded characters. By promoting physical health, mental resilience, and teamwork, sports prepare us for the broader challenges of life, making them an indispensable part of education and personal development.</p>

                    <p>Last night, I dreamt I was soaring through a twilight sky, not with wings, but simply by willing myself to rise. Below me, the city was a quiet patchwork of deep blues and soft, glowing orange lights. The air was cool and felt like silk against my skin. There was no sound except for a gentle, humming melody that seemed to come from the stars themselves. I flew over rooftops and between crystalline skyscrapers that shimmered with captured moonlight. A profound sense of peace and absolute freedom filled me, a feeling so vivid and real that when I woke up, for a fleeting moment, I was surprised to find myself in my bed and not still drifting among the constellations.</p>
